# @notion-stuff/scully-plugin-notion

This is a [Scully](https://scully.io) plugin to convert [Notion](https://notion.so) pages to static HTML pages
utilizing [@notion-stuff/blocks-html-parser](../blocks-html-parser/README.md)

> [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/) is currently in beta. There are content types that aren't being supported. Check the Notion API documentations for details

## Features

- [x] Convert Notion pages to static HTML
- [x] Access to Notion page properties as `Frontmatter` (should be `ScullyRoute` from `ScullyRoutesService`)
  - [ ] Customize Notion page properties
- [x] Customize HTML parsers. Please check out `NotionBlocksHtmlParser` documentations for more details.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @notion-stuff/scully-plugin-notion
```

> `@notion-stuff/scully-plugin-notion` depends on `@notionhq/client`

## Usage

> Notion integration steps courtesy of [Gatsby Source Notion Plugin author](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-notion-api/)

1. Created a Notion integration (sign in to Notion, go
   to `Settings & Memberships → Integrations → Develop your own integrations`
   , [short link to the Integrations creation section](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)). It’s OK to use an
   internal one. Don’t forget to copy the token:
   ![gif-1](https://files.readme.io/2ec137d-093ad49-create-integration.gif)

2. Go to the database you want to have access to from Scully, and share it with the integration (`Share` → Select the
   integration in the `Invite` dropdown). Don’t forget the database in the URL. It’s a series of characters after the
   last slash and before the question mark.
   ![gif-2](https://files.readme.io/0a267dd-share-database-with-integration.gif)

> Here’s a reference: https://www.notion.so/{USER}/**{DATABASE_ID}**?{someotherirrelevantstuff}
> If you only have 1 ID before the question mark in the URL, then the first ID is the Database ID
> i.e. https://www.notion.so/**{DATABASE_ID}**?{OtherIdThatDoesNotMatter}

3. Your database needs to have the following Page Properties (Table column headers)

| Title                   | Status                                    | Slug |
| ----------------------  | ----------------------------------------- | ---- |
| This should be default  | Select (a `Published` option is required) | Text |

- `Status` is required
  - `Published` status is required because this is being used by the plugin to set the `published` flag for a
    specific `ScullyRoute`. Although this is required for the plugin to work as expected, your intention (as plugin
    consumers) to use the `published` flag is totally up to you.
  - Note: the text `Published` is case-sensitive to set the published flag along with the column name of `Status`.
- `Slug` is utilized to setup the route to the post which is needed to be set manually as of the moment.
  - You can call `Slug` whatever you want but this needs to match `slugKey`

4. Configure the plugin in `scully.your-app.config.ts`

## Frontmatter (route metadata)

All columns in the table will be added to the route data which can be consumed
via [ScullyRouteService](https://scully.io/docs/Reference/ngLib/scully-routes-service/) along with the additional items from notion

> All column headers will be turned into [camelCase keys](https://github.com/nartc/notion-stuff/blob/main/libs/scully-plugin-notion/src/lib/utils.ts#L16) to be used in the frontmatter/config of the plugin

```ts
interface AdditionalNotionProperties {
  // link to the notion page cover image or null if one isn't set. Note: [someKey] is commonly external or file
  cover: null | { type: string, [someKey: string]: { url: string } };
  // url to the notion page
  notionUrl: string;
  // GUID of the notion page
  id: string;
}
```

```ts
import { ScullyConfig, setPluginConfig } from '@scullyio/scully';
import {
  NotionDom,
  NotionDomRouter,
  NotionPluginOptions,
} from '@notion-stuff/scully-plugin-notion';

setPluginConfig(NotionDom, {
  notionBlocksHtmlParserOptions: {
    /**
     ... customer the parser ...
     */
  },
} as NotionPluginOptions);

export const config: ScullyConfig = {
  projectRoot: './src',
  projectName: 'my-project',
  outDir: './dist/static',
  routes: {
    '/blog/:slug': {
      type: NotionDomRouter,
      postRenderers: [NotionDom],
      databaseId: 'your-database-id', // required
      notionApiKey: 'your-integration-secret', // if NOTION_API_KEY is set in Environment Variables, it is used instead of notionApiKey
      basePath: '/blog', // optional, should match your route here
      titleSuffix: '', // optional
      slugKey: 'slug', // optional
    },
  },
};
```
